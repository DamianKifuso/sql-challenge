#SQL CHALLENGE

As a Data engineer I was tasked to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains in the database of employees from that period are six CSV files. They requested me to create tables.
Firstly, I created ERD diagram using QuickDB to design the company database
I utilized PostgreSQL techniques to import CSV datasets and create tables for analysis. I then imported CSV data and created tables. Then I was able to export the results in CSV.

In summary I performed: -
1.	Data Modelling
2.	Data Engineering 
3.	Data Analysis
All have been attached for more details.
